Return status

Codes:
    - 6: Result received but not yet processed.
    - 7: Send is being processed
    - 8: Send completed successfully.

Steps:
- Collect data from the API POST
- Add data to the database (everything but the curve info), set "flag" to 100, ignore bits. Al will process this then change it to 101. (101 === SENT TO LIMS)
- Get the ID of the result just added the database
- Create a CSV with curve information in /var/www/html/curves/<id>.csv
    - This CSV will have up to 6 rows and up to 45 columns
- Return status '8' to signify that we're done

Curve data will be as follows:
- 'curve_data_1' -> up to 45 data points
- 'curve_data_2' -> up to 45 data points
- Up to 6 curves rendered per test

// We have data! Now we must clean it, add the result to the results table and make a CSV file.
